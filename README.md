## Skateboard

### Description
This assignment was to design a skateboard using Part Studios in OnShape, in order to use the geometry of the other parts to make the modelling of the subsequent parts easier. The skateboard is composed of a deck, trucks, which consist of a baseplate, hanger, and bushing, wheels, and bearings for the wheels.

### Reflection
This assignment was a good re-introduction to OnShape, and included a lot of helpful tips on various keyboard shortcuts. Some of the most helpful include "n", for normal, which situates a sketch or face normal to the nearest plane, "f", for fill, which causes the part(s) to fill the whole screen, "shift+e" to extrude, "d" to dimension, "c" for circle, and "shift+f" to fillet.
